	<h1>Max</h1>
	<article>
		<p>A grey domestic shorthair cat born in 2011. 
			<br> Max initially lived his life as an indoor cat.
			<br> When we moved to a small farm, he patrolled the field.
			<br> Now he is once again an indoor cat,
			<br> and doesn't wander any further than the backyard patio.
			<br> He becomes a pickier eater as he gets older.
